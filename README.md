SCALE A/V Coordination
======================

SCALE A/V is the team that handles A/V for the [Southern California Linux Expo](http://socallinuxexpo.org), an open source conference.  We consist of volunteers.  We are currently working on SCALE 12x, which will be on Feb 21-23, 2014 at the LAX Hilton.

This repository serves the dual purpose of serving up the [scale-av minimalist webpage](http://scale-av.github.io/scale-av-web/) as well as offering wiki and issue tracking for SCALE A/V logistics and planning.  

If you are interested in volunteering, please make sure you 
 - complete the [volunteer signup form](http://bit.ly/L0vGSa)
 - bookmark [scale-av minimalist webpage](http://scale-av.github.io/scale-av-web/). Please also bookmark the minimalist webpage.  We will be posting more information as we figure out logistical and technical issues.
 - sign up for the [scale-av mailing list](https://lists.linuxfests.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/scale-av).  That is where A/V-related discussions occur and where announcements will be made.  
 
If you want to edit the webpage, please switch to the gh-pages branch.
