SCALE A/V Coordination
======================

SCALE A/V is the team that handles A/V for the [Southern California Linux Expo](http://socallinuxexpo.org), an open source conference.  We consist of volunteers.  We are currently working on SCALE 17x, which will be on Mar 7-10, 2019 at the Pasadena Convention Center.

This repository serves the dual purpose of serving up the [scale-av minimalist webpage](http://socallinuxexpo.github.io/scale-av-web/) as well as offering wiki and issue tracking for SCALE A/V logistics and planning.  

If you are interested in volunteering, please checkout the website linked above.
 
If you want to edit the webpage, please switch to the gh-pages branch.
