== Podium Computer

image::/assets/podium-computer-front-panel-connections.png[]

. If there is an HDMI cable on the podium, hide it.
We do not want it to be used.
. Place the computer on the shelf of the speaker's podium.
. When connecting cables, you want to end with a clean and tidy set of cables running that are not in the way of the speaker and not a rats nest.
Do not allow wires to dangle.
. Connect the Ethernet cable labeled "`AV`" coming from the network switch into the **Ethernet ** jack.The other Ethernet cable labeled "`Speaker`" is for Presenter's Laptop use.
If the Ethernet cables are not already plugged into the network switch, you will need to connect the cables to the switches.
Please ask the NOC which ports are designated for you to use.
. Attach the 3.5mm to 1/4`" TS adapter plug to the 3.5mm TS audio cable coming from the Podium DI Box, then plug in the cable to the to the *Audio Out* jack (the middle one) to the Podium DI Box for the Room Sound System.
. Connect the audio wire of the VGA/Audio cable to the *Audio In* jack using the 3.5mm to 1/4`" adapter plug.
. Connect the VGA plug (using the side without the adapters) of the Speaker's Laptop VGA/Audio cable to the *VGA In* jack.
. Connect the VGA cable going to the projector to the *VGA Out* jack.
. Connect the KVM Source Switch to the *Switch* jack in the upper right by pushing in the connector.
Do not screw the connector in.
. Plug the AC side of the *AC adapter* power cord into a power outlet of the surge proctor inside or near the podium, but do not connect the DC side to the computer yet, this is because the computer may automatically turn on when power is connected.
. Connect the IEC cable to the AC Adapter IEC socket and connect the DC barrel plug to the *12V DC Power Connection* barrel jack.
. Alert the NOC that the computer is connected and if instructed, press the *Power Switch* to power on the machine.
. Confirm that the Podium Computer has a good network connection by looking at the inner motherboard through the clear top lid of the case.
You should see both a solid blue *Link light* and a flashing orange *Activity light*.
. Test the KVM Video Switch by pressing the pushbutton on the ** KVM remote**.
Each time you press the remote, one of two lights near the VGA Out port will turn on, indicating which source is active.
. Tape the Laminated Speaker Reminder Flyer to the top of the podium.
. Tape the KVM switch about 6 inches from the bottom edge of the podium towards the left edge of the top of the podium.

= Room Testing Procedure

This procedure can be run by just a volunteer with a year or more experience.
New volunteers should pair with more experienced volunteers.*When in doubt, ask an A/V expert for help.
**"`Easily audible`" means loud enough to hear in a room full of people, but not so loud that it is painful or distorted.
"`Elevated enough`" means as high as it can go and still be stable.
Typically this is high enough to look over standing audience members (approximately 8 feet).
** Please do not adjust audio settings without AV NOC approval.*

. Test the in-room audio levels.
Audio should be noise-free and clear in all areas of the room and easily audible.
Have your setup partner stand near the loudspeaker and then later in the back of the room to confirm that you are audible.
When testing a microphone, hold the microphone near your mouth and talk at a normal level, letting the microphone do the amplification of the voice.
Count to ten to ensure that your partner has enough sample audio to listen to for each test.
Check the audio levels of the following devices:
 .. Earset microphone
 .. Handheld microphones #1 and #2 (if present)
 .. Laptop audio feed (VGA/Audio cable) by plugging in a 3.5mm test source such as a phone or laptop.
** Avoid playing copyrighted sounds when testing, such as music.
** If you have a phone, record your voice and play it back.
 .. (If present) Panel microphones
. Request attention from the Monitoring Computer operator.
. With consultation from the Monitoring Computer operator, check that the camera has been set up properly:
 .. Camera should have a clear view of the podium
 .. Camera should be elevated enough to see over audience
 .. Camera feed should be clean
 .. Camera should not wobble on the stand.
If using a Samsung Camera, the Camera mount should extend over a leg for stability.
. Help the Monitoring Computer operator check the recorded audio levels.
For each item in Step 1 above, ensure that the monitoring computers pick up clear audio on the audio channel of the monitoring feed.
. Ensure that no other noise or interference is in the room.
Report if there is something unusual about a room that might affect audio quality, such as flickering lights, loud fans, hum/buzz, etc.
. Done!
** If issues were detected, please notify A/V NOC.**
