=== Room Testing Procedures ===

This procedure can be run by just a volunteer with a year or more
experience. New volunteers should pair with more experienced volunteers.When in
doubt, ask an A/V expert for help. “Easily audible” means loud enough to hear
in a room full of people, but not so loud that it is painful or distorted.
“Elevated enough” means as high as it can go and still be stable. Typically
this is high enough to look over standing audience members (approximately 8
feet). Please do not adjust audio settings without AV NOC approval.

* [ ] Test the in-room audio levels. Audio should be noise-free and clear in
all areas of the room and easily audible. Have your setup partner stand near
the loudspeaker and then later in the back of the room to confirm that you are
audible. When testing a microphone, hold the microphone near your mouth and
talk at a normal level, letting the microphone do the amplification of the
voice. Count to ten to ensure that your partner has enough sample audio to
listen to for each test. Check the audio levels of the following devices:

** [ ] Earset microphone

** [ ] Handheld microphones #1 and #2 (if present)

** [ ] Laptop audio feed (HDMI/Audio cable) by plugging in a 3.5mm test source such as a phone or laptop. Avoid playing copyrighted sounds when testing, such as music. If you have a phone, record your voice and play it back.

** [ ] (If present) Panel microphones

* [ ] Request attention from the Monitoring Computer operator.

* [ ] With consultation from the Monitoring Computer operator, check that the camera has been set up properly:

** [ ] Camera should have a clear view of the podium

** [ ] Camera should be elevated enough to see over audience

** [ ] Camera feed should be clean

** [ ] Camera should not wobble on the stand. If using a Samsung Camera, the Camera mount should extend over a leg for stability.

* [ ] Help the Monitoring Computer operator check the recorded audio levels. For each item in Step 1 above, ensure that the monitoring computers pick up clear audio on the audio channel of the monitoring feed.

* [ ] Ensure that no other noise or interference is in the room. Report if there is something unusual about a room that might affect audio quality, such as flickering lights, loud fans, hum/buzz, etc.

Done! If issues were detected, please notify A/V NOC.
